Notes regarding the saltstack states that I expect about my machines.
This directory is also the one that should be mounted in the salt-master
machine as the /srv/salt directory, so that I can effectivly edit the files on whim,
and backup to SpiderOak.


# Is there a way to run only certain state checks, rather than the whole tree?


===============================================================================
UNPLACED SERVICES:
    These are the things I've wanted, without the headache of maintenance.
    Now that I have a saltstack, it should be a non-issue.

- Icinga monitoring software
- Logging server
- Security system of rasperry pi?
    # Using the motion lib, and zoneminder?
    # This would be a pretty sweet use of saltstack to 'deploy cameras'
- Kindle webface for reading all my books from any wifi point.
- Media server to WAN, for all my movie and music needs.
- Spotify on wine server (so I can jam!!)
- Pandora recorder
- Cluster nodes, as SSI if possible. (arm architecture)
    # Open MPI??
- Sparkleshare (dropbox equivalent)?
- SiP and phone to allow landcalls?
    # Haha.. maybe I will end up with a landline again..

SERVICES FOR MIGRATION:
    Existing services that need to go into salt.state files, so that I may
    rebuild anything on the fly, or move services from one vm to another
    seamlessly.
    
- Torrent server
- Tor / tor-browser in -X forwarded env
- Samba
- Murmur server

===============================================================================

I will be placing salt-minions on all of my virtualboxes,
But I need to plan for what levels the services will be installed on.

# All Linux machines, Win Machines will differ?
Base:
  '*':
    - zsh
    - vnstat
    - sshd
    - sysklogd
        - configured to log remotely to the archive, by hostname/day rotation
    # The additional things that I can now apply 'across the board' to my servers
        # such as removing login by password, only allowing keys.
    - security_enhancements
        - nopass
        - ssh_authorizedkeys
        - ufw, or iptables..
        - able to set up chroots?
        
        
# Device shifting media.
'athenaeum':
  - HandBrakeCLI
  - samba
  - samba.cfg


# Maybe I can fix the 'crashing torrentd' here, by forcing a rerun of my update script.. instead of by hand.
'prometheus':
  - transmissiond
  - transmissiond.conf
  - tornode
      - allow me to 'surf' using this machine, like I currently have my Debian-Testing box
  - cronjobs for purge
